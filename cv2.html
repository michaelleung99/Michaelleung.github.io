<p> Life is short as a lot of people say and I truly believe that. Going out and exploring the world to see 
what nature is like is how I want to live my "short" life. Around the world, there are different 
countries and different cities that have different past and different cultures from us. My goal in life is see all 196 countries in the world and learn about 
their culture. So far in my life, I have visited a lot of places in the Unites States and some countries around the world like Hong Kong, Canada, Thailand, and Japan, but in the coming years I hope to expand my 
travels and knowledge of the world. </p>

<p>Below are some pictures of some places I have travelled to thus far:  </P>
